# Dishbabes🧼🫧
A cute little app to remind me and my sister who's on dish duty today ;)

### Technologies🫧🖥️
- Python (Django)
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- ChatGPT for debugging
- Co pilot for efficient development

### Features🧼📁
* Auto update of the washer even if app is dormant
* Overriding capacity to allow swapping days
* History log of when who washed
* Dark mode
* Avatar of washers
  
### The Process🧼🧪
1. Defining how the washers will be set and assigning a numberical boolean value to said person
2. Importing the date to mark when washer washed
3. Assigning the date to a person and displating it in the current or history log

### What I Learned🧼🤓
- I learned when self would be a better fit instead of kwargs and args in functions
- How to sort data from newest to oldest in the database using meta in the model
- Working with the datetime module

### What could be improved🧼👷🏾‍♀️
- The overall appearance of the template, gamifying it would be cooler
- Adding a focus state on the avatar representing the washer

### How to run the project 🧼🔮
- Follow the link to the render site
- Mark a day washed or manually override the log.
- Or simply view whos day it is to wash
